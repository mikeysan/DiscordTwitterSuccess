# Overview
This Discord.py bot will take channels in Discord and post the images sent there to Twitter. There are numerous customization options included. In order for this system to work, you will also need a Twitter developer account. You can apply for developer account access [here](https://developer.twitter.com/). This program offers a variety of setup options and configurations to affect styling of the messages. For more information and an in depth guide on how to set this up, visit the [tutorial links](https://github.com/HeroicosHM/DiscordTwitterSuccess#setup-tutorial) below.

# [IMPORTANT] - Common Issues
If you get an error that says something along the lines of:
```
File "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\lib\site-packages\tweepy\streaming.py", line 358
    def _start(self, async):
                         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
That is an issue with the Python twitter api wrapper not liking how it was written. You will need to go into the folder listed in the error and replace the current `streaming.py` file with the `streaming.py` file in this repository. Message me on Discord if you have issues.
